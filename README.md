Implemention of a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms given in the dataset.

House price prediction involves estimating the potential value of a property in the future, aiding stakeholders such as real estate professionals, sellers, and buyers in making informed decisions. This practice combines analytical techniques, historical trends, and current market dynamics, serving as a pivotal aspect of the real estate transaction process despite its intricacies. Employing machine learning methodologies, this entails leveraging past data to forecast future housing costs, encompassing tasks such as model selection, data acquisition, and preprocessing. Despite challenges such as data quality and market volatility, machine learning algorithms offer effective tools for enhancing predictive accuracy. For instance, utilizing a Linear Regression model, one can predict house prices based on various factors like square footage and number of bedrooms, utilizing a dataset with multiple features for each property.
